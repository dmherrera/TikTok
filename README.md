# Project Name: TikTok Claim Detection Model
## Part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate

At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. With our company's flat structure, youâ€™ll have dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

## Project Description

TikTok users can report videos and comments that contain user claims, flagging content for review by moderators. This generates a large volume of user reports, which can be challenging to address promptly. To enhance the efficiency of content moderation, TikTok is developing a predictive model to determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion.

### Objectives:
- **Develop a predictive model**: Create an accurate model to identify whether reported content contains claims or opinions.
- **Reduce backlog of user reports**: Streamline the moderation process by prioritizing reports more effectively.
- **Improve moderation efficiency**: Enable faster response times for content review and maintain a safe platform environment.

### Impact:
A successful prediction model will help TikTok reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. This will not only enhance the moderation process but also ensure that TikTok remains a joyful and creative space for users.

Join us in this initiative to improve content moderation and maintain the integrity of the TikTok community.
